# Skeleton of a IRC bot (I'd just call it Rachel)

A bit prolonged weekend project that I already had forgotten.
It's beginnings of IRC bot written in Python. I might
continue working on it some day. Currently the bot has (at least)
the following features:

	- Supports one server and one channel
	- Can op users based on user whitelisting
	- Can give ops/voice to certain users automatically
	  when they join
	- Configured via .conf files
	- Logs discussion on the channel
